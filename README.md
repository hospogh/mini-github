Objective

During this assignment you are going to implement an app that will list
users and repositories from GitHub as well as show their details. The goal
is to showcase your skills in single page application development and your
knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript without using any frameworks or
libraries.

Requirements

Navigation
There should be 2 navigation items - Users and Repositories. Clicking on
them should take users to the Users and Repositories pages respectively
and current navigation item should be highlighted (see wireframe 1).
Users page
On Users page there should be a search text input and no users
displayed by default. When entering a search criteria and hitting the Enter
button on keyboard, all GitHub users matching that criteria should be
displayed with their avatar images and usernames. The users’ list should
be paginated showing only 20 users per page and Next/Previous buttons
to navigate to the next or previous pages respectively when available.
When clicking on a user from the list User’s details page should be
displayed.
User’s details page
On User’s details page user’s avatar image, username and a list of his/her
repositories should be shown (see wireframe 2). User’s repositories list
should match the same requirements as the Repositories page (see below).

Repositories page
On Repositories page there should be a search text input and no
repositories displayed by default. When entering a search criteria and
hitting the Enter button on keyboard, all GitHub repositories matching
that criteria should be displayed with their name and URL. The
repositories’ list should be paginated showing only 20 repositories per
page and Next/Previous buttons to navigate to the next or previous pages
respectively when available (see wireframe 3).
General
Navigation history should be preserved so i make use of browser’s
back/forward buttons. Also i need to stay on the same page even if i
refresh the browser window. The app should run perfectly on latest
versions of mainstream browsers (not you, IE!).
Evaluation

The assignment will be evaluated by following criterias (the more matches
the better):
● Modularity
● Code style/consistency
● Code reuse
● Maintainability
● Usage of modern browser features and JS standards
● Design patterns
● Documentation

You, yes You are the architect, designer, developer and owner of this
awesome application. Treat it as an opportunity to test your skills and
have fun with vanilla JS.

Do your best , use your imagination and rock it.

Good luck.
